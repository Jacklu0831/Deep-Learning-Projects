# Deep Learning Projects

Deep learning projects from beginner (ex. shallow NN, backprop) to advanced (ex. YOLO, generate jazz music). Topics including deep neural network, improving neural network, building neural network project, convolutional neural network, and sequence model. The meme cited in the inception network paper is the highlight of this journey (https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842 P11). Started with only using numpy for shallow NN, then moved on to tensorflow with/without keras for deeper networks.

# Acknowledgement

As declared in the description, this collection of projects is mentored by Stanford Professor Andrew Ng through the Coursera Deeplearning Specialization. Thanks to his guidance, I gained balanced knowledge of both the theory and the practical application of deep learning. 

## With all sincerity, thank you Andrew Ng for making learning priceless knowledge inexpensive.
