# Acknowledgement

As declared in the description, this collection of projects is mentored by Stanford Professor Andrew Ng through the Coursera Deeplearning Specialization. Thanks to his guidance, I gained balanced knowledge of both the theory and the practical application of deep learning. 

### With all sincerity, thank you Andrew Ng.
