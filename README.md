# Deep Learning Projects

Deep learning projects from beginner (ex. shallow NN, backprop) to advanced (ex. YOLO, generate jazz music). Topics including deep neural network, improving neural network, building neural network project, convolutional neural network, and sequence model. Started with only using NumPy for shallow NN, then moved on to tensorflow with/without keras for deeper networks.
